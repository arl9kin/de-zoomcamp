1. SELECT count(*) FROM `project.trips_data_all.fhv_tripdata`; 43244696
2. external: This query will process 0 B when run.
   internal:This query will process 317.94 MB when run.
3. SELECT count(1) FROM citric-optics-374013.trips_data_all.fhv_internal
   WHERE PUlocationID is null and DOlocationID is null; 717748
4.Partition by pickup_datetime Cluster on affiliated_base_number
  I would partition by pickup_datetime, truncated to day. Because the column is used for filtering, that means BQ will query only necessary partiotion.
  And clusering on affiliated_base_number will optimise order by queries.
5. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Affiliated_base_number)) FROM project.trips_data_all.fhv_internal_partitoned_clustered
   WHERE DATE(pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-03-01' AND '2019-03-31'
   ; 
  usual This query will process 647.87 MB when run.
  clustered This query will process 23.05 MB when run.
6. I would say not GCP Bucket, but GCS Bucket.
7. No. If the data volume less 1GB, partitioning/clustering makes no/little sense.
